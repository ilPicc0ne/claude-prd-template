# Project Description

**Replace this with your basic project idea!**

Describe what you want to build in 2-3 sentences. Include the main problem you're solving and who your target users are. More details will be gathered during the PRD creation process.

## Example:

```
I want to build a mobile app that helps busy parents track their children's school activities and communicate with teachers. The main problem is that parents miss important school updates and struggle to stay organized with multiple children's schedules.
```

## Next Steps:

1. Run `/prd_create_base` to generate your initial PRD
2. Use `/prd_expand` to create detailed specifications
